Things that need to be done:

///////////////////////////////////////////////////-Get Models.py working optimally. Come up with better ER model. Simplify if we need to.

-Have a good populate.py working. Just a few examples for us to make sure it works.

-Make add_recipe, add_category(maybe?) pages.
 
-Make a user page.
	-will need to contain an inventory and a shopping list.
	-can add things from the shopping list into the inventory (shopping list can be saved?)

-New users can log in/make accounts.

-Make a page which lists recipes.
	-Can add the list of ingredients to the user's inventory
	-Recipes should be listed by rating, probably...
	-Make a possible search where recipes which have ingredients which are not in your inventory ommited.

-Make sure adding a recipe will make a new page for that recipe. (If that's the easiest way to do it)

-And I guess that's it really..?
